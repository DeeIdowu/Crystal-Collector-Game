# Crystal Collector Game
This is web application which renders a random number at the beginning of the game thus requiring you to click the gemsicons below to accumulate and equate to the random number that was originally rendered.

You win the game by attaching your total score to random number, you lose the game if your total score goes above the random number.

The value of each crystal is hidden from you until you click on it. Each time the game starts, the game will change the values of each crystal.
